    "**What is the input:**  \n",
    "- the input is text that has a lot of rows containing fake news and right news and has some noise needed be cleaned\n",

    "**What data mining function is required:**\n",
    "- data mining function is required  classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**What could be the challenges**\n",
    "- the challenges are to clean the text data by Preprocessing techniques in NLP to make the sentence pure to predict correctly and choose best classifier for this mission.\n",

    "**What is the impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing the spread of rumors and fake news\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is an ideal solution:**\n",

    "- the ideal solution is getting high accuracy for predict which fake or true news,and which model perfect to train input text (NLP or text classification) in this proplem randomforest classifier is the best and logestic regresion"
